# Executive Summary
In lab 2 we are introduced to hardware and data representation. This lab covered the areas on how the components of a computer function together to make it work for people. It also went over how computers operate in binary and how they store or transfer information throughout the components of the computer. The goal of this lab was to furter our understanding of computers and how data is presented.
# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
The difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive is that latencies are the amount of time it takes for it to read or find data while tranfer rates is the speed at which data is tranferred from or to the disk media.
A solid state hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive because it store data in memeory chips while a traditonal hardrive store it on a disk.
i. Increasing RAM makes a computer run faster because more data can be loaded into the RAM without the need of accessing the slower hard drive.
ii. The difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths is that 64 bit systems are faster because they can tranfer double the amount of data per clock cycle
## ALU and the Control Unit
The control unit is a component of the CPU that tells the ALU what type of operation to preform.
## CPU, Input & Output
The example adresses all 3 of the components because the CPU gets information from the input such as pressing a key on the keyboard. Then the CPU sends pixel information in binary to the screen which is your ouput and all of that happens really fast.
## Logic Gates and Circuits
A truth table shows your ouput for every input.The NAND truth table is just the AND with the outputs reversed.
## IEEE
The purpose of IEEE is to advance technology for the benefit of humanity.The importance of ethics in device design is to allow people to design safe,trusted,respected devices/systems for people to use.
# Data Representation
## Numeric Conversions
Decimal system use a base 10 system (0-9). Binary uses a base 2 system (0-1). Hexadecimal uses a base 16 system (0-F).
## Hexadecimal Color Representations
The hexadecimal color #ab00FF is a violet color.
This color wouldn't be a problem on the web because the use of complementary will colors help anyone with low vision impairments.
# Conclusion
In this lab I learned even more information about computers. I learned a lot about the components of a computer such as the CPU, RAM, motherboards, hard disks, and many more. It's really fascinating how these components work together. I also learned more about binary, decimal, hexadecimal coversions and NAND, AND, OR gates. When I was in high school we learned about these topics but I only understood a little bit. After going through this lab it made me understand more about the conversions and gates. Overall this was a fun lab and I'm glad I learned something new.
